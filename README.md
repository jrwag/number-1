# Python: Assignment 3
This script is an assignment for Introductory Python.
It determines the area of a circle by defining pi and radius and creating a formula for area. 
```
pi=3.14 #rounded to 2 digits
r=2.0

#Area formula
area=pi *(r**2) #two asteriks is exponents

#perimeter formula
perim = 2.0*pi*r

#These create outputs in a sentence.
print ("Given r: ", r)
print ("Area is: ", area)
print ("Perimeter is: ", perim)
```
